# Architecture

Purinina re-implements the **multi-agent architecture of CAI** on top of
[opencode](https://opencode.ai), in TypeScript. It contains no CAI source code —
only the architectural ideas, expressed idiomatically for opencode.

## Design principle: opencode is the runtime, Purinina is the architecture

opencode already solves the hard, easy-to-get-wrong problems: a great terminal
UI, provider/model management, the agent execution loop, tool calling, bash
integration, and a permission system. Re-building those would be wasted effort
and a source of bugs. So Purinina treats opencode as the **runtime + interface**
and layers the CAI-style architecture on top via three seams opencode exposes:

1. **Agents** (`runtime/agent/*.md`) — the specialist personas.
2. **A plugin** (`runtime/plugin/purinina.ts`) — cross-cutting logic: the HITL
   policy, the safety floor, and engagement tools.
3. **Config** (`runtime/opencode.json`) — permissions that route intrusive
   actions through the HITL policy and protect the host.

All of this is baked into a Docker sandbox as opencode's **global config**, so
the entire architecture is present the moment opencode starts inside the box.

## Why "agents + plugin", not "a plugin OR an agent"

A common question is whether Purinina should be _an opencode plugin_ or _a
separate agent_. The answer is **both**, and that mirrors CAI: CAI has both agent
definitions _and_ an SDK/runtime with tools and policy. In Purinina:

- The **personas** are naturally opencode agents (prompt + tool scope + model).
- The **cross-cutting behavior** (HITL, safety floor, engagement tools, and the
  orchestration pattern engine) needs the plugin, because the plugin is the only
  place with access to opencode's hooks and SDK client at runtime.

## Orchestration: phased approach

Purinina's pattern support is delivered in phases (a deliberate decision to ship
a correct vertical slice first):

- **Phase 1:** idiomatic opencode. The `orchestrator` primary agent decomposes
  the engagement and delegates to specialists with the built-in `task` tool.
- **Phase 2 (implemented — essential set):** an explicit **pattern engine** in
  the plugin that drives agents programmatically via the opencode SDK client
  (`session.create` + `session.prompt` with a target `agent`). It is exposed as
  orchestrator-only tools:
  - `purinina_parallel` — independent tasks run concurrently, each in its own
    session/context; results aggregated.
  - `purinina_pipeline` — agents run in sequence, each fed the previous output.
  - `purinina_swarm` — peer-to-peer hand-offs; the engine routes by parsing a
    `HANDOFF: <agent> — <task>` / `DONE` directive in each agent's reply.

  Design choices:
  - **Orchestrator-only:** the engine tools are disabled on subagents — this
    caps per-turn token cost and prevents recursive/runaway orchestration.
  - **HITL still applies:** spawned agents run in child sessions that pass
    through the same `permission.ask` gate.
  - **Per-agent models apply:** spawned agents use their configured model.
  - **Bounds:** parallel ≤ 8 tasks, swarm ≤ 6 hops.

  > The engine compiles and loads cleanly; its live behavior (nested
  > `session.prompt` driving subagents) is validated through real runs.

## Roadmap

1. **Remaining patterns:** `conditional` (predicate routing) and `hierarchical`
   as first-class tools; `unified` vs `split` context option for parallel.
2. **Declarative `purinina.yml`** for multi-agent line-ups (analogue of CAI's
   `agents.yml`), running the same engine with zero model-context cost.
3. **More specialist agents** toward CAI parity: `blue-team`, `bug-bounty`,
   `dfir`, `reverse-engineering`, `network`, `wifi`, `memory`, `compliance`, etc.
4. **Tooling depth:** richer per-category tools and result parsers.
5. **Policy as an extracted, unit-tested module** (the risk classifier currently
   lives inline in the single-file plugin; extraction + a bundled build will let
   us ship a proper test suite) and the deferred HITL hardening (fail-safe on
   empty command, anti-obfuscation).
6. **Tracing & cost controls** mirroring CAI's price/turn limits.
